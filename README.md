Reference Hub – Link Rotting Detection System

Reference Hub is a mini project designed to solve the problem of link rotting — a common issue where external URLs become unavailable, broken, or permanently moved over time.
Such dead links reduce the reliability of any system that depends on external resources, such as educational platforms, documentation hubs, or information portals.

This project automatically monitors all stored reference links and ensures that only active, valid links are displayed to users.
